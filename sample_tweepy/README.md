This is a collection of some exploratory code with working with Tweepy,
the Python Twitter API wrapper.

I was able to get two scripts going, one for getting all the historical tweets
from the past 7 days (maximum history from a free Twitter API), and another 
for starting a stream that grabs tweets based on a filter of user choice.
